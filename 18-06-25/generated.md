# ðŸ“˜ C++ Bitwise Operators - Quick Reference

This document provides a summary of C++ Bitwise Operators, as referenced from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-bitwise-operators/). Bitwise operators operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

## ðŸ§  What Are Bitwise Operators?

Bitwise operators are used for performing operations on binary representations of integers. These are low-level operations and are especially useful in systems programming, competitive coding, and embedded systems.

## ðŸ”§ List of Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Name           | Description                                             | Example (x = 5, y = 9) |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `&`      | Bitwise AND    | Each bit of result is 1 if both corresponding bits are 1| `x & y` = 1            |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR     | Each bit of result is 1 if at least one bit is 1       | `x | y` = 13           |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR    | Each bit of result is 1 if bits are different          | `x ^ y` = 12           |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT    | Inverts all bits                                        | `~x` = -6              |
| `<<`     | Left Shift     | Shifts bits left and fills 0 on the right              | `x << 1` = 10          |
| `>>`     | Right Shift    | Shifts bits right and discards bits on the right       | `y >> 1` = 4           |

## ðŸ§ª Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 9;

    cout << "x & y = " << (x & y) << endl;
    cout << "x | y = " << (x | y) << endl;
    cout << "x ^ y = " << (x ^ y) << endl;
    cout << "~x = " << (~x) << endl;
    cout << "x << 1 = " << (x << 1) << endl;
    cout << "y >> 1 = " << (y >> 1) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
x & y = 1
x | y = 13
x ^ y = 12
~x = -6
x << 1 = 10
y >> 1 = 4
```

## ðŸ§± Bitwise Operator Tricks & Applications

Here are some common tricks using bitwise operators that are frequently used in competitive programming and system-level code:

### 1. **Check if a number is even or odd**
```cpp
if (x & 1) cout << "Odd";
else cout << "Even";
```

### 2. **Swap two numbers without a temporary variable**
```cpp
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;
```

### 3. **Check if a number is a power of 2**
```cpp
bool isPowerOfTwo = (n > 0) && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0);
```

### 4. **Clear the ith bit**
```cpp
x = x & (~(1 << i));
```

### 5. **Set the ith bit**
```cpp
x = x | (1 << i);
```

### 6. **Toggle the ith bit**
```cpp
x = x ^ (1 << i);
```

### 7. **Get the ith bit**
```cpp
int bit = (x >> i) & 1;
```

### 8. **Count number of set bits (Hamming Weight)**
```cpp
int count = 0;
while (x) {
    count += x & 1;
    x >>= 1;
}
```

## ðŸ§® De Morgan's Laws

De Morganâ€™s Laws describe how logical expressions involving NOT, AND, and OR can be transformed using complement rules. These are extremely useful when simplifying bitwise conditions or Boolean algebra in programming.

### Laws:

1. **NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B)**  
   `~(A & B) = (~A | ~B)`

2. **NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B)**  
   `~(A | B) = (~A & ~B)`

### Example:

```cpp
int A = 5;   // 0101
int B = 9;   // 1001

cout << "~(A & B) = " << (~(A & B)) << endl;
cout << "(~A | ~B) = " << ((~A) | (~B)) << endl;
```

**Both expressions above will yield the same result**, confirming De Morganâ€™s Law.

## ðŸ§© Notes

* Bitwise operations are only applicable to integer types.
* These operations are faster and can be used to optimize performance-critical code.
* `~` performs 1â€™s complement; signed integer results depend on compiler's number representation (usually 2's complement).
* Shifting by a negative or out-of-range value leads to undefined behavior.
