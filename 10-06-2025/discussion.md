TOdo : 
    vedic maths  program with deviation : make a sort list of deviation from highest deviation to lowest  and print it

    Time Constraints
        - read time constraints and identify bounds


    Binary Exponentiation
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-exponentiation-for-competitive-programming/


finding out the time complexity based on the constraints and calculating 


environment runtine 
    let r = runtime and e = enviornemnt runtime
    n = frequency
     
    when a program is loaded it takes e time  to create the environment like the memory reservation for the etc


    so (nr+e)/n  = r + (e/n) 

    this is frequency averaging
