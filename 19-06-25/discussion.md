power of 2 

    n & (n-1) == 0 -- > property


Calculate no of 1 bits in a number

floor(log10(n)) + 1 === > digits of number in decimal number system 
floor(log2(n)) + 1 === > digits of number in binary number system 



Time Complexity of basic operation like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulo

Logical vs Arithmetic shift for negative and positive numbers
    for negative numbers when shifting is done a 1 is added instead of 0
    for a positive number when shifting is done a 0 is added to fill in the empty space

1 << 31 is negative 
1 << 30 is pos


MSB --> MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT ---> left most bit
LSB --> LEAST  SIGNIFICANT BIT --> right most bit
